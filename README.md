# TBX-For-V2-and-FHIR
Free download of the TBX tools, to build transforms between HL7 Version 2 and FHIR

Transforms By Example (TBX) is a toolset for developing healthcare data transforms, particularly with FHIR.

Using TBX, you create a transform by creating example pairs (of source and target) showing what the transform must do. The tools do the rest. This is economical, and promotes reuse of transforms.

For uses involving just HL7 Version 2 and FHIR, you can download TBX free from this repository.

For other uses, license TBX from http://www.openmapsw.com/ .
