# TBX-For-V2-and-FHIR
Free download of the TBX tools, to build transforms between HL7 Version 2 and FHIR

Transforms By Example (TBX) is a toolset for developing healthcare data transforms, particularly with FHIR. For more information, see https://github.com/robertworden/TBX-Tutorials .

For uses involving only HL7 Version 2 and FHIR, you can download TBX free.

As the TBX Eclipse plugins are more than 25 MB, you can't get them from this repository. You need to download them from http://www.openmapsw.com/ .

This repository contains other useful material to go with the TBX tools - such as instructions to install them, and a guided tour project.
